# Description
This project aims to develop a predictive model to estimate recovery time after an injury. By using historical injury data, the model predicts the recovery duration based on various factors such as the nature of the injury, the patient's age, the treatments received, and more.

# Features
- Data Analysis: Collection and processing of historical injury data.
- Predictive Modeling: Use of machine learning techniques to predict recovery time.
- Visualization: Graphs and visualizations to interpret predictions and underlying data.
